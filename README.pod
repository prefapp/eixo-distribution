=head1 NAME

Eixo::Distribution - Suite of Perl modules to interact with Docker::Distribution

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Eixo::Distribution::Api;
    
    my $a = Eixo::Distribution::Api->new('http://127.0.0.1:5000'); 

    # list images
    my ($image) = $a->images->list;

    # get images tag
    my @tags = $a->images->tags($image);

    # load an image
    my $i = $a->images->get(name=>$image, reference=>"latest");

    # see total size (in bytes)
    $i->manifest->totalSize;
    
    # image manifest
    $i->manifest;

    # delete the blobs and manifest of an image
    $i->delete;

        # Important!! In the actual revision of the Docker::Distribution, the blobs and manifest are only marked 
        # to be erased. To really delete them, it is necessary to run an administrative task (cf. garbage-collect)
